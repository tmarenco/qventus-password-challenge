# Password Challenge

---

First of all, thank you very much for this opportunity. I hope I did everything correctly, but if there are any issues, I am open to suggestions to improve the code. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did while working on it.

## Observations

- I couldn't find the exact same icons used in the prototype, so I used similar ones available in the Material-UI library.
- During the development process, I considered using libraries like Formik or React Hook Form to handle form inputs more effectively, especially for larger and more complex forms. However, for the purpose of this challenge and to keep the project lightweight, I decided to manage the form state and validation manually without relying on external libraries. I preferred to minimize the use of external libraries to maintain simplicity and reduce dependencies.
- Regarding the requirement that the password "Has NO consecutive letters", I interpreted this to mean that the password cannot contain three or more letters that are consecutive in alphabetical order (e.g., "abc", "def"). I wasn't entirely sure if this was the correct interpretation, but I implemented the validation based on this assumption.
